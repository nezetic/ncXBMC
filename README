ncXBMC
==================

ncXBMC is a remote XBMC client, which aims to provide a full control of 
the music player over a local network.

It can be used to browse library, manage playlist, and control playback.

The interface as been greatly inspired by ncmpc (http://hem.bredband.net/kaw/ncmpc/), 
a curses client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD) (I'm a fan).


Usage: ncxbmc.rb [options] hostname
